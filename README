Initrd-helpers contains scripts and tools that can be used in init ramdisks.

General guidelines for initrd helper scripts:

* All debug / error / warning / info prints should be passed to /dev/kmsg
* This way problems can be seen from journal or dmesg if device booted up

The tools:

btrfs-mount-repair - Btrfs mounting script with automatic repair operations

Usage: ./btrfs-mount-repair <device> <mount-directory>
       device          - btrfs device to be repaired and mounted
       mount-directory - where to mount the device
NOTE:  If repair is succesful, device will be left mounted in
       mount-directory


find-mmc-bypartlabel - Tool for finding MMC device node by it's partition label

Usage: find-mmc-bypartlabel <label-name>
       label-name      - Labeled name of the partition
NOTE:  If mmc device with that partition label is found the device node path
       is printed

Examples:
       # find-mmc-bypartlabel sailfishos
       /dev/mmcblk0p14

       # export SFOS_DEV=$(find-mmc-bypartlabel sailfishos)
       # echo $SFOS_DEV
       /dev/mmcblk0p14

factory-reset-lvm - Tool for running factory reset for LVM based file systems

Usage: factory-reset-lvm <root-size> <reserve-size>
       root-size       - size of root LV in MB
       reserve-size    - space in MB to be left unallocated for future use

NOTE:  The script will need a "fimage" partition with image directory that
       contains root.img and home.img loop image files for root and home
       factory content. Partition name may be overriden by configuration. Image
       directory name must end with version and device information that are
       separated by '-' character. Version must contain major and minor version
       number. The partition may not include other similarly named directories
       that could be mistaken as image directory.
